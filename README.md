The objective of the game is to collect 10 Stars and gain 200 Points.
  -Each Star is worth 2 points
  -Touching the water is worth 10 points
  -Getting hit by an enemy loses you 5 points

Move the player using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). The player
can move to any space on the board. If the player is hit by an enemy, it
will reset the player to its original starting block. The same will happen
if the player reaches the water.
